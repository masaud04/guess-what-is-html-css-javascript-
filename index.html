            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
              <br>
              Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
              <br>
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme todetermine which style rule applies if more than one rulematches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme ispredictable.

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
              <br>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiledlanguage that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It hasdynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, andfirst-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supportingevent-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. Ithas application programming interfaces (APIs) for working withtext, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, andthe Document Object Model (DOM).
